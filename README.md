# Plugin-Manager
The idea of this is to create a base for extendable functionality within a pre-compiled binary without having to recompile your binary. All you would have to do is generate a plugin template, add your new functionality to that plugin, compile only the plugin and load it into the binary. This also maeans that the plugins can be built seperately and distributed independent of the main binary.

I also wrote this to be able to have multiple plugins loaded at the same time and be able to call them independently of each other.
